- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sekhararipak
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and contribute to the community wherein both Application and Infrastructure that runs the application is treated as one unit.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring Cloud Native Compute Foundation (CNCF)'s open source initiatives like Radius, Dapr, KEDA, and Copacetic to achieve seamless build, deploy & configure Applications & Infrastructure and reduce the build & operations overhead for enterprise IT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Radius, Dapr, KEDA, and Copacetic
